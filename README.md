# Snake AI Game

Welcome to the Snake AI Game! This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game with an AI component that learns to play the game using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Classic Snake game mechanics
- AI that learns to play the game
- User-friendly interface
- Real-time game visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-ai-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd snake-ai-game
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

The AI uses reinforcement learning to learn how to play the Snake game. The main components are:
- **Environment**: The game environment where the Snake moves and interacts with food.
- **Agent**: The AI agent that learns to play the game by receiving rewards for its actions.
